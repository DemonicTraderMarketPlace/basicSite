Steps To Running The App
========================

1: Run the bookListDatabase.sql script to built the sql database to run the app.

2: Download and run Event Store, found [here](https://eventstore.com/downloads/)

3: Open the app in your IDE of choice, BookList.sln will open both the front end and the back end.

What We Want To See Built
=========================

On the top of the home page there is a button that says books.  Please build a simple but clean page which will allow you to add books, view all of the books already in the database, and remove a book as well.  The Server already has an endpoint for each of those actions.

Please use Vuex for state management and vue-router to manage routing.
